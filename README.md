# AIT Framework

The AIT framework (previously called the *Dragonfly factory*) will be going public in 2022 after +30 odd years :-) 
The Open Source edition will progressively replace all proprietary versions.

This Github repository will house the releases and replaces ISLE's very old FTP server which has be put to a definitive rest in 2020 (farewell to our last physical server still in operation on US grounds).

Don't expect the source code to be available here for some time though, because there is a lot of proprietary code to strip off and that can still take quite some time.

This repository will also be used to [track issues](https://github.com/ISLEcode/AIT/issues) of the rejuvenated framework. So as to avoid any confusion as to when a program is an AIT component or not, we have added the following signature to all usage outputs.

```
This utility is part of the AIT framework (Dragonfly core components).
Please report bugs and issues to <https://github.com/ISLEcode/AIT/issues>.
```

For third party components included in the AIT framework we have, wherever possible, adapted the usage information to point to the correct issue tracker.
